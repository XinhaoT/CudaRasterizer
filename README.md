# Differential Gaussian Radiance Fields 3D Sampler

This is an implementation of the Differential Gaussian Radiance Fields 3D Sampler, a component of the "As-Rigid-As-Possible Deformation of Gaussian Radiance Fields" paper implementation.

It is an extension on the codebase of the rasterization engine for the paper "3D Gaussian Splatting for Real-Time Rendering of Radiance Fields".
